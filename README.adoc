# Securing Spring Boot and Redis with SSL/TLS

This repository contains a sample of configuring a Spring Boot client application to use a Redis server with SSL/TLS.

The source code for the sample is from https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-redis/[Spring Guides].

The Redis SSL/TLS configuration is derived from https://github.com/allen-munsch/docker-redis-ssl-example.

## Running the sample

Generate client and server SSL certificates with a root certificate authority and copy them to the server and application:

```bash
./scripts/gen-redis-certs.sh
```

Build and run the application:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file to start the Redis server in a Docker container.
You don't need to manually run `docker compose up`, as https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.1.0-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#features.docker-compose[Spring Boot will do that for you].

If successful, you will see two messages at the end of the log output containing:

```
Sending message...
Received <Hello from Redis!>
```
