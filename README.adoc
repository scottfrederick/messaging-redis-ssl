# Securing Spring Boot and Redis with SSL/TLS

This repository contains a sample of configuring a Spring Boot client application to use a Redis server with SSL/TLS.

The source code for the sample is from https://spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-redis/[Spring Guides].

The Redis SSL/TLS configuration is derived from https://github.com/allen-munsch/docker-redis-ssl-example.

## Running the sample

Generate client and server SSL certificates with a root certificate authority and copy them to the server and application:

```bash
./scripts/gen-redis-certs.sh
```

Start the Redis server in a Docker container using Docker compose:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Build and start the application:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

If successful, you will see two messages at the end of the log output containing:

```
Sending message...
Received <Hello from Redis!>
```
